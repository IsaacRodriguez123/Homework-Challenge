**Positive Extraction Control Batch Creation**
==============================================

1. Background
-------------

College of American Pathologists (CAP)-Accredited Laboratories are required to perform positive and negative quality control testing throughout the entire testing process as part of quality assurance and the Quality Management Plan. Prior to obtaining CAP Accreditation, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Lab relied on the FDA-Approved Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requirements for Quality Control testing, using a post extraction RNA based Covid 21 positive control that was not subjected to the sample extraction procedure and introduced after sample RNA extraction. As part of on-going improvements and compliance with CAP Accreditation, an external Positive Extraction Control (PEC) that will be tested in accordance with normal patient testing procedures and span the full procedure of Covid 21 testing. The existing protocol contains an external negative control that is tested in accordance with normal patient testing procedures and spans the full procedure of Covid 21 testing.


2. Scope
--------

This protocol applies to the creation of a PEC batch that utilizes 5 positive samples that show amplification in all 3 genes (N, S and ORF1ab). The batch of samples is quantified using RUO dd-PCR and is then diluted, a 1:20,000 dilution, to a target of 5 times the Limit of Detection (LOD) for an average CT value of 31 to 32.

This Positive Extraction Control (PEC) batch is divided into single-use aliquots for long-term storage and daily use for each extraction session.

7. Test Process
---------------
      7.1 Prepare Samples

          7.1.1 Thaw samples at room temperature. 

          7.1.2 Vortex for 30 seconds and centrifuge for 1 minute at 2000 XG.

      7.2 Label three 2 mL tubes: A, B and C.

      8.2 dd-PCR Results Explained

          8.2.1 The initial sample representing the positive pool (tube C) contained a 1:2 dilution with a total 
                tested volume of 400 μl.

          8.2.2 The dd-PCR was run on Tube A with an average number of copies/gene/μl of approximately 3 million/mL, 
                but must be multiplied by the dilution factor of 2 for a total of 6 million/ mL

                8.2.2.1 Note that the sample concentration is in copies/mL and must be divided by 1000 to convert to 
                        copies/μL.

          8.2.3 For the initial positive sample batch in tube B  the concentration was 6,000 copies/μL.  

          8.2.4 The limit of detection for the current post-extraction positive control is 24 copies/μL.  

          8.2.5 For the pre-extraction positive control a goal of at least 5 times the Limit Of Detection (LOD); 120 
                copies/μL is targeted.
                
       8.3 Calculate the Volume Needed From the Positive Pool Stock to Make PEC Aliquots
       
           8.3.1 The sample testing process is 400 μL of sample, which is extracted to 50 μL of eluate, and 17.5 μL of 
                 eluate is transferred to a RT-PCR plate for testing.  With a target of 120 copies in a 400 μL sample, 
                 this equates to 0.3 copies/μL or 300cps/mL per sample concentration. 
 
           8.3.2 The number of copies in the elution: 120 copies/50 μL = 2.4 copies/μL

           8.3.3 The number of copies transferred to RTPCR: 2.4 copies/μL times 17.5 μL of eluate transferred to RTPCR 
                 = 42 copies

           8.3.4 Use the dilution equation:  C1*V1=C2*V2  
 
                 8.3.4.1 C1 = Concentration 1

                 8.3.4.2 V1 = Volume 1

                 8.3.4.3 C2 = Concentration 2

                 8.3.4.4 V2 = Volume 2

           8.3.5 The initial stock concentration, C1, is equal to 6,000 viral copies/μl, while the target 
                 concentration, C2, is 0.3 viral copies/μL and the target volume, V2, is 36,000 μL of sterile saline.
  
                 8.3.5.1 The target volume is selected by anticipating a one month supply of 450 μL aliquots and using 
                         approximately 20/week or 80/month. 

                 8.3.5.2 80 aliquots times 450 μL is 36,000 μL = 80 aliquots of 440 μL with dead volume.  

           8.3.6 C1*V1 = C2*V2
                 (6,000 copies/μL)*V1 = (0.3 copies/μL)*(36,000 μL)
                 *V1=1.8* μL of sample stock

           8.3.7 The final dilution factor is 20,000.

             8.4.1 Perform RT-PCR from the positive pool batch, at the correct dilution, in triplicate.
